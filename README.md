# Plastic pollution vs Country's per capita income in Tableau
This project depicts the relationship between plastic pollution and country's per capita income
 Most of the data used in the analysis came from:
https://ourworldindata.org/, https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD, https://plasticoceans.org/the-facts/
The research questions I tried answering to:
1. Why is there an increase in plastic production across every country each year?
2. Which country is producing more plastic and what is its recycling and mismanagement rate?
3. Is there any relation between the per capita income of a country and its plastic mismanagement?
4. Is the coastal population having any effect on plastic pollution?
5. Relation between Coastal plastic pollution and the highest plastic-producing countries.
